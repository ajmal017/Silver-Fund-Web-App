Make sure to create a local secrets.py file within the IB_Client folder containing two variables, myUsername and myPassword (specific to your account).

NOTE: secrets.py is in the .gitignore, so it won't get posted publicly to GitHub

Example of secrets.py file:
myUsername = "user101"
myPassword = "password123"
