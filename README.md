Make sure to create a local secrets.py file within the IB_Client folder containing two variables, IB_USERNAME and IB_PASSWORD (specific to your account).

NOTE: secrets.py is in the .gitignore, so it won't get posted publicly to GitHub

Example of secrets.py file:
IB_USERNAME = "user101"
IB_PASSWORD = "password123"
